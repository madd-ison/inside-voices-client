# INSIDE VOICES
* A full stack React app with authentication, Inside Voices was designed to serve as a mental health hub for people living in New York City, primarily those who choose not to interact with social media apps and therefore do not have easy access to the abundance of resources circulated within them. 

* Includes a journal app to track daily thoughts and growth, guided and instrumental meditations, and a colossal list of local organizations that provide food, healthcare, housing, and other services to those who truly need them. I plan to continuously expand this project.
